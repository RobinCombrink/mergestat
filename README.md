**beta**

MergeStat is a project to sync data from [`mergestat-lite`](https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat-lite) queries into PostgreSQL tables.
It behaves similar to an ETL tool, taking data from git repositories and the GitHub API and regularly updating tables in a database.
It's intended purpose is to enable "operational analytics for engineering teams," where downstream tools may consume the data from the PostgreSQL database.

## Running Locally

Try Fuse out locally with `docker-compose` by cloning this repository and running

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Now if you visit `http://localhost:3300/` you should be able to access our management UI where you can begin adding repositories and syncing data.

**NOTE** if you'd like to make use of GitHub API data (any sync type that uses the GitHub API **including repo auto imports**) or any private GitHub repos you will need to supply a GitHub [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
We are working on GitHub auth alternatives, but for now a PAT is your best bet.

You can manage a single PAT for your instance in the `Settings` area of the management UI.

## Examples

Take a look at all of our [examples](./examples/examples.md)

You can also visit `http://localhost:3000/` to access a local [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) instance with example dashboards using the data from Fuse ðŸŽ‰ :

### Resetting a Local Instance

If you'd like to "start from scratch" (i.e. reset the Fuse DB and start with a fresh deployment), run the following:

```
docker-compose down
```

```
docker volume rm fuse_db_data
```
